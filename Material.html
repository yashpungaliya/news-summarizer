Though Lalu Yadav, whose children are named in a retinue of corruption cases, would like the cover that being in power can offer while fighting their cases, Nitish Kumar seems set on punching out of the alliance - days not, not weeks, say sources close to him about the approaching lights off.
At Nitish Kumar's party meeting yesterday, many leaders warned him that staying attached to Lalu Yadav at this time could irreversibly smear his image of Sushasan babu - a clean and efficient administrator whose three terms in Bihar have remained free of major corruption scandals.
