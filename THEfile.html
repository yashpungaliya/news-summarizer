 However, the ultrasonic dryer uses piezoelectric transducers to remove moisture when high frequency voltage is applied to the transducers, they vibrate at a high frequency causing trapped water to leave the fabric without heat.
 We're trying to develop the technology that has efficiency greater than or equal to the state of the art but with a competitive cost, so it can be sold on the US market because if you walk into a big box store and you want a dryer, normally the first things consumers look for is how much it costs and not energy efficiency.
Called the ultrasonic dryer, it's expected to be up to five times more energy efficient than most conventional dryers and able dry a large load of clothes in about half the time.

Despite the lowering of interest rates on PPF, experts still suggest that conservative investors should go for it for long-term savings as compared to bank deposits.
 In contrast, duration funds adopt the strategy of generating a big part of their returns from appreciation in bond prices that happen when interest rates decline.
Interest rates on small savings schemes, including PPF or public provident fund, have gone down in recent years, in line with the general trend of interest rate in overall financial system.
